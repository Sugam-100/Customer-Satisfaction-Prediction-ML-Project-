# Customer Satisfaction Prediction (ML Project)

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction levels using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to analyze customer feedback and other relevant data to classify whether a customer is **satisfied** or **dissatisfied**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with graphs & charts  
- Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Visualization of insights (confusion matrix, bar graphs, pie charts)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning models & evaluation  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
- The dataset includes customer details and their feedback.  
- Columns include demographics, product/service usage, and satisfaction labels.  
- Target Variable: **Customer Satisfaction** (Satisfied / Not Satisfied).  

---

## 📈 Workflow  
1. Import & clean dataset  
2. Perform EDA and visualize patterns  
3. Apply preprocessing techniques  
4. Train ML models and tune hyperparameters  
5. Evaluate performance metrics  
6. Visualize results  

> 📌 **Graphs to include in report/ppt**  
- Pie chart → Satisfied vs Dissatisfied customers  
- Bar chart → Feature importance (from Random Forest)  
- Heatmap → Correlation between variables  
- Confusion Matrix → Model performance
